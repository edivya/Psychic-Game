## Light Bulb Psychic Game

The computer will randomly choose a letter from the alphabet. The goal is for the user to guess that letter by pressing a key on the keyboard.

The user is allowed 9 chances to guess the correct letter. The game will display each incorrect guess the user makes.

The game will prevent the user from making any guesses that aren't letters a - z. The game will also prevent the user from repeating previous guesses. Neither of these mistakes will count as one of the user's 9 chances.

Each time the user guesses a letter correctly, their win count increases by one, and the screen will light up with a surprise image. If they fail to guess the correct letter in 9 chances, their losses count increases by one.

Each time the user wins or loses, the game will restart without reloading the page.
